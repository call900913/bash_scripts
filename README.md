# Shell Scripts

I wrote these scripts to practice Vim. Have a look if there is anything in here that you like. 

## 1. add_date_to_jpg.sh
This script adds today's date to the names of all the .jpg files in its folder.
e.g. mypicture.jpg -> 2022-03-22--mypicture.jpg

## 2. tell_machine_to_say_hi.sh
This interactive script tells your machine to say hi.

## 3. ping_host.sh
This script checks whether the host you specify is reachable.

## 4. hello_name.sh
Says hello to a couple of names.

## 5. copy_files.sh
This script makes a copy of the file you enter in the prompt.

## 6. function_to_log.sh
A logger script that logs a message you input.
